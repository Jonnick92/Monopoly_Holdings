# Monopoly_Holdings in TypeScript!

To play the game with the current version, make sure Python is installed on your computer. After installation, proceed by downloading the code files. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing these files and execute `python -m http.server`. This will launch a local server.

You can now access the game by going to `localhost:8000` in your web browser, allowing you to play directly from your computer using Python's built-in HTTP server features.
